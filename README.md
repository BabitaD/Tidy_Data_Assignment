# Tidy_Data_Assignment

The script requires the dataset to be present in the ./data folder as defined by following file structure.
  
 * [/](./tree-md)
   * [data](./dir2)
     * [train](./dir3)
     * [test](./dir3)
     * [features_info.txt](./dir2/file21.ext)
     * [features.txt](./dir2/file22.ext)
     * [activity_labels.txt](./dir2/file23.ext)
     * [README.txt](./dir2/file24.ext)
  
  The script outputs a file TidyData.txt in the working directory containing the final output i.e. tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
